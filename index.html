        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          In Malawi, households contribute about 12% of Total Health Expenditure
          through out-of-pocket payments (OOP). Such a financing structure
          leaves households vulnerable leading to financial hardship resulting
          from Catastrophic Health Expenditures (CHE). The aim of the study was
          to identify determinants of Catastrophic Health Expenditures and
          estimate the distribution and extent of impoverishment due to
          out-of-pocket expenditures across households in Malawi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondary data from a nationally representative survey of 11,434
          households in the 2019–2020 Integrated Household Survey (IHS5) was
          used. Data analysis involved both Descriptive and Regression analysis.
          Descriptive analysis utilized percentages to assess the incidence and
          intensity of Catastrophic Health Expenditures, along with their
          impoverishing effects. CHE thresholds of 10%, 15%, 25%, and 40% of
          total and non-food expenditure were used. Logistic regression was used
          to identified determinants of CHE at the 40% non-food threshold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Results showed CHE incidence ranging from 26.0% at the 10% threshold
          to 1.7% at the 40% non-food threshold. The mean overshoot was 6.33%,
          indicating that among households incurring CHE, health spending
          exceeded the threshold by an average of 6.33% of non-food expenditure.
          Richer households were significantly protected from financial
          hardship. Rural households, those with young children, elderly members
          (65+) and female-headed households were more vulnerable. Households
          which had members with chronic illness were at greater risk of
          financial hardship.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unexpected results showed that insured households were at a high risk
          of incurring CHE. Importantly, households with members suffering from
          illnesses such as hypertension, body and joint pains, fever/malaria,
          sore throat, stomach ache, skin problems, wound and other chronic
          conditions had significantly higher odds of incurring CHE, while
          health-seeking behaviors had the highest effects: households using
          mission/CHAM facilities (AOR = 7.69, 95% CI: 5.52–10.72, p &lt;
          0.001), or private facilities (AOR = 4.11, 95% CI: 3.27–5.16, p &lt;
          0.001) were far more likely to incur CHE compared to those that did
          not use each service. Households that used informal commercial sources
          had lower risk of CHE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out-of-pocket spending pushed additional 0.7% of Malawian population
          into poverty and pushed already poor people further down into poverty
          by 1.4%. More cases of a particular illness in a household as well as
          more of a particular health seeking behavior were generally associated
          with higher CHE and impoverishment estimates. In conclusion, the study
          identified sociodemographic, illness and care seeking factors as
          determinants of catastrophic health expenditures in Malawi hence the
          need for financial risk protection policies.
