        <h2>Chapter 4 — Methodology</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This chapter outlines the theoretical framework and methodology for
          the study. The sections following this introduction cover the
          theoretical framework adopted, the method used for robustness checks,
          and the model specification for the determinants of catastrophic
          health expenditures. Estimating the incidence and intensity of
          catastrophic health expenditures and impoverishment, as discussed in
          the Theoretical Framework section, is crucial. It will highlight the
          extent of financial hardship associated with out-of-pocket
          expenditures in Malawi. Understanding the determinants of these
          catastrophic health expenditures, as presented in the model
          specification section, will also guide policy direction. Finally, the
          chapter discusses the data sources that will be used in the study.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Theoretical Framework</h3>
        <p>
          This study adopts the Grossman Model of Health Capital Demand
          (Grossman, 1972) as the primary theoretical lens to examine the
          determinants of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) at the
          household level. The Grossman model conceptualizes health not merely
          as a consumption good that yields direct utility but also as an
          investment good that enhances individuals’ productivity, longevity,
          and economic potential (Grossman, 2000). In this framework, health is
          treated as a form of capital stock that depreciates naturally over
          time but can be augmented or maintained through investments such as
          medical care, proper nutrition, safe water, sanitation, and healthy
          lifestyles (Mushkin, 1962; Muurinen, 1982).
        </p>
        <p>
          At the heart of the Grossman model is the assumption that households
          act as rational agents who seek to maximize lifetime utility subject
          to income and time constraints. The utility function depends on both
          health status and the consumption of other goods, and decisions about
          health investments involve comparing the marginal benefits of improved
          health with the costs of health inputs. These investments draw on both
          direct financial resources and time inputs and are influenced by
          household preferences, information, and the structure of the
          surrounding health system (Grossman, 1972; Wagstaff, 1986). When
          illness strikes, particularly chronic conditions or severe acute
          episodes, the depreciation of health capital accelerates, prompting
          greater health investment needs. Yet, under financial constraints,
          households often face difficult trade-offs. Some delay treatment or
          resort to lower-quality care, while others are forced to mobilize
          significant financial resources, sometimes exceeding sustainable
          levels. Such events may culminate in catastrophic health expenditure,
          defined by the World Health Organization as health spending surpassing
          a critical share of household resources (e.g., ≥10% of total
          expenditure or ≥40% of non-food expenditure) (Wagstaff et al., 2003;
          Xu et al., 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Grossman framework explains why vulnerability to CHE is
          systematically linked to household characteristics and behaviour.
          Households with higher income and better education tend to have
          greater capacity to finance health care and are more efficient in
          producing and maintaining health (Cutler & Lleras-Muney, 2010).
          Education improves health literacy, enabling households to adopt
          preventive measures and make informed choices about when and where to
          seek care. Conversely, lower-income and less-educated households may
          delay or forgo preventive care, increasing the risk of more severe
          health episodes and higher costs when care is eventually sought
          (Gottret & Schieber, 2006). The effective price of health inputs,
          which includes not only user fees but also travel costs and time lost
          from work, further influences these decisions. For instance,
          households living far from health facilities incur higher indirect
          costs, which can deter timely care and exacerbate health shocks when
          care finally becomes unavoidable (Garchitorena et al., 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
          Health insurance, where present, mitigates these risks by lowering the
          effective price of health care, enabling households to maintain health
          capital without incurring prohibitive out-of-pocket (OOP) costs
          (Ekman, 2004; Nguyen et al., 2012). In its absence, households rely
          more heavily on direct payments at the point of service, making them
          susceptible to financial distress when illness episodes are severe or
          frequent. Household demographics also matter: larger households or
          those with many dependents, such as children or elderly members, face
          higher illness exposure and more competing demands on income and time,
          increasing their vulnerability to CHE (Buigut et al., 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
          Health status and illness burden are critical in this framework, as
          chronic illnesses, recurring symptoms, and multiple comorbidities
          reduce the stock of health capital and necessitate repeated or
          prolonged investments in care (Odhiambo et al., 2020). These health
          conditions, represented in this study by reported disease symptoms
          such as backache, blood pressure problems, respiratory infections,
          malaria, and others, directly translate into increased health care
          demand and expenditures. Health-seeking behaviour, moreover,
          influences both the magnitude and pattern of spending. Households that
          opt for private or mission facilities, or that rely on informal and
          traditional care, face different cost structures and treatment
          outcomes, which in turn shape financial risk (Kruk et al., 2009). In
          the Grossman context, these behaviours reflect household preferences
          and constraints in the allocation of resources for health production,
          reinforcing the idea that CHE is not merely the product of random
          shocks but of systematic factors rooted in health needs, health
          behaviours, and economic capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the Grossman model provides a robust theoretical foundation for
          this study. It links socioeconomic status, insurance coverage,
          household composition, illness burden, and health-seeking behaviour to
          patterns of health care use and financial risk. This integrated
          perspective justifies the inclusion of variables capturing not only
          socioeconomic and demographic factors but also reported disease
          conditions and treatment choices, ensuring that the empirical analysis
          accounts for both the demand for health care and the economic
          consequences of healthcare utilization. CHE, in this view, is an
          outcome of household-level production and consumption decisions under
          health shocks and financial constraints, rather than a purely random
          financial event.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Model Specification</h3>
        <p>
          This study utilizes a logistic regression model to explore the
          characteristics of households related to Catastrophic health
          expenditures. Based on Xu (2005), the functional form of the model to
          estimate the determinants of Catastrophic health expenditures is
          expressed as:
        </p>
        <p>
          y = α + Σβi Xi <br />
          y = ln (p/(1-p))
        </p>
        <p>
          where:<br />
          <strong>y</strong> is a dummy variable on catastrophic health
          expenditure, taking the value of 1 if the household experiences
          catastrophic health expenditure and 0 otherwise.<br />
          <strong>α</strong> is the constant,<br />
          <strong>βi</strong> is the coefficient of the independent variable
          Xi<br />
          <strong>Xi</strong> are the independent variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          The explanatory variables considered include broad categories such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Socioeconomic and demographic factors: household insurance status,
            location (urban/rural), education of household head, household size,
            socioeconomic status, household age structure, age and gender of
            household head.
          </li>
          <li>
            Health condition indicators: presence of chronic illness; number of
            individuals with disease burdens such as backache, blood pressure,
            body and joint pains, cough, dental problem, diarrhoea, eye problem,
            fever/malaria, headache, heart problem, other illnesses, respiratory
            infection, skin problem, sore throat, stomach ache, and wound.
          </li>
          <li>
            Health-seeking behavior: treatment choices such as doing nothing,
            government facility, informal commercial sources, mission and CHAM
            facility, private facility, or traditional and personal remedies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>p</strong> is the probability of a household facing
          catastrophic health expenditure.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Data Sources</h3>
        <p>
          The study utilized secondary data collected by the National
          Statistical Office (NSO) of Malawi between April 2019 and April 2020
          under the Fifth Integrated Household Survey (IHS5). The IHS surveys
          are conducted roughly every 3 to 5 years and serve as a key instrument
          for the Government of Malawi to monitor changing household conditions.
          The IHS is also a vital tool for tracking progress toward achieving
          the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the objectives of the
          Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS).
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of this study, the IHS6 dataset had not yet been released;
          thus, the IHS5 represented the most recent and comprehensive
          nationally representative dataset available.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IHS5 covered a wide range of topics relevant to this study,
          including: household demographics, education, health, consumption,
          food security, and durable goods. Importantly, the survey provides
          detailed information on household expenditures and health status,
          which are essential for the analysis of catastrophic health
          expenditures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The survey employed a stratified two-stage sampling design based on
          the 2018 Population and Housing Census (PHC), with representativeness
          ensured at the national, regional, urban/rural, and district levels.
          The final achieved sample consisted of 12,288 households from 768
          Enumeration Areas (EAs), with an overall response rate of 93 percent.
