        <h3>1.1 Statement of the Research Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) requires that all
          individuals access essential healthcare services without suffering
          financial hardship. However, in many low-income countries, including
          Malawi, households continue to face substantial out-of-pocket (OOP)
          payments when seeking healthcare. These payments can be unpredictable
          and burdensome, leading to catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) that
          divert resources from basic needs and, in extreme cases, push
          households into poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Malawi, healthcare is officially provided free at the point of care
          in public facilities, yet significant costs remain due to medicine
          stock-outs, transport expenses, and the use of private and mission
          facilities where user fees are charged. The health financing landscape
          is heavily donor-dependent, with external funding accounting for over
          50% of total health expenditure, while households themselves
          contribute about 12% through OOP spending. Such a structure leaves
          households vulnerable, especially as donor funding becomes less
          predictable and domestic resource mobilization remains limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          Findings from a study conducted between 2019 and 2020 on the uptake of
          health insurance in Malawi revealed that only 1% of the Malawian
          population was covered by health insurance, with 47% of the insured
          population obtaining coverage through their employers (Ng’ambi et al.,
          2023). This leaves a substantial portion of the population vulnerable
          to financial strain from healthcare costs. Furthermore, disparities in
          coverage between urban and rural areas are evident, with urban
          residents more likely to have access to insurance schemes compared to
          their rural counterparts, despite approximately 84% of the Malawian
          population residing in rural areas (McBride & Moucheraud, 2022). With
          the absence of social health insurance schemes and out-of-pocket
          expenditures accounting for 11.9% of total health expenditure, a
          significant proportion of Malawi's population remains at risk of
          financial hardship and impoverishment due to excessive medical
          expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previous studies in Malawi (e.g., Mchenga et al., 2017; Mulaga et al.,
          2021) have established the presence of CHE and its impoverishing
          effects. However, apart from a recent illness-specific study on sickle
          cell anemia by Kamya et al. (2025) who found that malaria episodes are
          a major driver of catastrophic health expenditures in Malawi and
          Uganda, most studies have focused primarily on broad socioeconomic and
          demographic determinants as well as national estimates of catastrophic
          health expenditures and impoverishment incidence. Further, the study
          on Malawi and Uganda mentioned above focused on disease specific
          evidence for one illness; sickle cell anemia, not nationally
          representative illness disaggregated analysis. Thus, there remains
          limited understanding of how nationally representative
          illness-specific factors, health-seeking behaviors, and healthcare
          provider choices influence financial risk exposure. The distribution
          of catastrophic health expenditures and impoverishment estimates
          across households for various illnesses and health seeking behaviors
          is also less explored. In addition, there lacks updated evidence on
          incidence and poverty implications of catastrophic health expenditures
          that is necessary given changing disease patterns, rising chronic
          illness burdens, and ongoing health financing reforms, such as those
          outlined in the Malawi Health Financing Strategy 2023–2030 and Health
          Sector Strategic Plan III (HSSP III). This is the knowledge gap this
          study seeks to fill.

            Out-of-pocket expenditures do not significantly affect the
            incidence, intensity and distribution of Catastrophic health
            expenditures across households in Malawi.
          </li>
          <li>
            Out-of-pocket expenditures do not significantly affect the
            incidence, intensity and distribution of poverty in Malawi.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.5 Significance of the Study</h3>
        <p>
          This study makes an important contribution to the literature on health
          financing and financial risk protection in low-income countries, with
          a particular focus on Malawi. While previous studies on catastrophic
          health expenditure (CHE) in Malawi (e.g., Mchenga et al., 2017; Mulaga
          et al., 2021) have provided valuable insights into the incidence and
          determinants of CHE, they have generally been limited to aggregate
          socioeconomic and demographic factors. This study advances existing
          knowledge in several unique ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, it uses nationally representative data of 11,434 households and
          applies logistic regression to examine the determinants of CHE,
          integrating not only socioeconomic and demographic variables but also
          illness-specific factors and health-seeking behaviours. This approach
          provides a more detailed understanding of how disease profiles and
          provider choice influence financial risk, an area largely unexplored
          in previous Malawi-focused studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, the study estimates both the incidence, intensity and
          distribution of CHE across multiple thresholds (10%, 15%, 25%, 40%)
          and expenditure definitions (total versus non-food expenditure). By
          doing so, it provides a detailed picture of financial risk
          distribution under varying policy-relevant assumptions, improving
          comparability with global and regional benchmarks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third, the study examines the poverty implications, also known as the
          impoverishing effects, of out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare payments on
          household poverty and poverty gaps, offering updated estimates of how
          health expenditures push households into poverty or deepen their
          existing poverty. This is critical for informing Malawi’s current
          health financing reforms, including the Health Financing Strategy and
          the Health Sector Strategic Plan III (HSSP III), which emphasize
          financial risk protection as a pathway to Universal Health Coverage
          (UHC).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the study provides evidence-based recommendations to guide
          policy action. It highlights vulnerable populations, such as
          households with chronic illness, dependents (children under five and
          elderly members), and those using private or mission/CHAM facilities,
          that require targeted financial protection mechanisms. These insights
          are directly relevant for policymakers seeking to design equitable
          health financing strategies, reduce OOP burden, and build a resilient
          health system.
        </p>

        <h3>1.6 Scope and Delimitation of the Study</h3>
        <p>
          This study focused on examining the determinants, distribution and
          impoverishing effects of catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) in
          Malawi using nationally representative data from 11,434 households.
          The analysis employed multiple thresholds of CHE (10%, 15%, 25%, and
          40% of total and non-food expenditure) to provide a thorough
          understanding of financial risk exposure under different
          policy-relevant definitions. The determinants considered include
          household socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, health status
          (including chronic illness and illness-specific conditions), and
          health-seeking behaviours such as facility choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study also assessed the impact of out-of-pocket (OOP) health
          expenditures on household poverty, measuring changes in the poverty
          headcount and poverty gap before and after health spending. Logistic
          regression model was applied to identify significant predictors of
          CHE, while impoverishment analysis on policy implications employed
          standard poverty measurement techniques. Findings were contextualized
          within Malawi’s evolving health financing landscape, including the
          Malawi Health Financing Strategy and the Health Sector Strategic Plan
          III (HSSP III).
        </p>
        <p>
          While this study offers valuable insights, certain delimitations are
          worth noting. The analysis is based on cross-sectional household
          survey data, which limits the ability to capture long-term coping
          strategies adopted by households following health expenditure shocks.
          In addition, the household expenditure data, including OOP health
          payments, relied on respondent recall, which may be subject to
          measurement error and recall bias.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study did not disaggregate health insurance types or benefit
          packages in detail as that data was not available; hence, findings
          related to insurance and CHE reflect general patterns rather than
          scheme-specific impacts. Finally, while the study incorporated
          illness-specific and behavioural factors, it did not explicitly
          examine clinical outcomes or quality of care, which could also
          influence health-seeking behaviour and financial risk exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In spite of these limitations, the study provides comprehensive and
          policy-relevant evidence on financial risk protection in Malawi and
          highlights priority areas for health financing reforms.
