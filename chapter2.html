        <h2>Chapter two — Background of the Study</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This chapter discusses the structure and organization of the Malawi
          healthcare system. It further explores the country's health financing
          system regarding how resources are mobilized, how risk is spread, and
          how healthcare services are purchased. It also examines the challenges
          faced by the health financing system and the efforts and policy
          reforms implemented to address these challenges. It concludes by
          discussing the policy reforms outlined in the Health Sector Strategic
          Plan III (HSSP III), 2023-2030.
        </p>

        <h3>
          2.2 Structure of Malawi Healthcare System and Health Service Delivery
        </h3>
        <p>
          The backbone of healthcare services delivery in Malawi is the
          government, which administers services through the Ministry of Health
          (MOH). Throughout the country, each district boasts public hospitals
          that offer services free of charge at the point of care. Following
          closely in scale is the not-for-profit Christian Health Association of
          Malawi (CHAM), consisting of church-affiliated health facilities. CHAM
          facilities operate with a focus on community well-being rather than
          profit. The Islamic Health Association of Malawi (IHAM), though
          smaller in size compared to CHAM, also plays a role in providing
          healthcare services. There are, also, scattered independent private
          health facilities across the nation, operating on either a for-profit
          or not-for-profit basis. (Health Account Report, 2020)
        </p>

        <h3>2.3 Organization of Malawi Healthcare System</h3>
        <p>
          The health system in Malawi has three levels: primary healthcare,
          secondary healthcare, and tertiary healthcare. A referral system links
          together these three tiers. (MoH, 2020)
        </p>

        <h3>2.3.1 Primary Healthcare</h3>
        <p>
          In Malawi, health centers and community hospitals are distributed
          across the country, and they constitute the majority of primary
          healthcare service providers. Only 39.4% of Total health expenditures
          is allocated to primary healthcare which is low, given that financing
          primary healthcare is important to ensuring financial risk protection
          and achieving universal health coverage as it ensures allocative
          efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>2.3.2 Secondary Healthcare</h3>
        <p>
          The secondary healthcare tier comprises district hospitals that are
          publicly owned. There is a total of 21 district hospitals located in
          various health districts in the country. Some secondary healthcare
          facilities are also provided by the Christian Health Association of
          Malawi (CHAM) in a Public-Private Partnership with the government. In
          Malawi, secondary healthcare facilities also provide primary
          healthcare services and that explains the low funding for primary care
          as some primary care funds are channeled to secondary care facilities
          to provide primary care services. (MoH, 2023)
        </p>

        <h3>2.3.3 Tertiary Healthcare</h3>
        <p>
          Tertiary healthcare services are provided by central hospitals. There
          are four central hospitals located in the cities of Zomba, Lilongwe,
          Blantyre and Mzuzu; Zomba Central Hospital, the Kamuzu Central
          Hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital and the Mzuzu Central
          Hospital respectively.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4 Malawi Healthcare Financing System</h3>
        <p>
          At the heart of the Malawi healthcare system lies the Malawi health
          financing system acting as the driving force of all health
          interventions strategized by the Ministry of Health.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4.1 The Goal of the Financing System</h3>
        <p>
          As indicated in the Malawi Health Financing Strategy 2023-2030, the
          goal of the Malawi health financing system is to mobilize and
          distribute adequate resources, efficiently and equitably, and to
          purchase services strategically based on a well-defined health benefit
          package to achieve Universal health coverage goals. (MoH, 2023). This
          aligns with the National health policy goal adopted by the Malawi
          Health Sector Strategic Plan III, 2023-2030. The goal is to improve
          the health status of all Malawians and increase the satisfaction of
          clients as well as financial risk protection towards achieving
          universal health coverage.
        </p>

        <h3>2.4.2 Structure and Functions of the System</h3>
        <p>
          The health financing system in Malawi is a core function of the Malawi
          healthcare system. It is the channel to progress toward Universal
          health coverage through improving service coverage and financial risk
          protection. The system performs the three traditional health financing
          functions of resource mobilization, pooling, and purchasing of
          healthcare services. It however also performs a fourth function of
          health benefit package design (MoH, 2023).
        </p>

        <h3>2.4.3 Resource Mobilization</h3>
        <p>
          The financing structure of Malawi's healthcare system relies on
          multiple sources of funds, including donors (external financing),
          private health expenditures (household out-of-pocket expenditure,
          medical insurance, and other corporate funds), and the government
          through the Ministry of Finance. The government utilizes solidarity in
          financing health through funds collected via taxation. These funds are
          directed through financial agents, encompassing government bodies,
          non-governmental organizations, and private organizations (Zere et al,
          2010). These mandatory contributions are effective as far as financial
          risk protection and universal health coverage are concerned since they
          encourage cross-subsidization from the rich to the poor. Donor
          contributions constitute a significant portion of Malawi's Total
          Health Expenditure (THE). According to the National Health Financing
          Strategy 2023-2030 (MoH, 2023), total health expenditure is made up of
          24.1% from government contributions, 54.5% from external financing,
          11.9% from out-of-pocket expenditures, and 9.1% from private
          healthcare insurance.
        </p>

        <h3>
          2.4.5 Domestic Health Resource Mobilization Strategies in Malawi
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>i. Introduction of optional paying services:</strong> The
          Ministry of Health stepped up optional paying services in central
          hospitals and further piloted paying wards in two secondary care
          hospitals: Nkhotakota and Nkhata-Bay. This was done to increase the
          resource mobilization capacities of hospitals. With this arrangement,
          all patients continue to access the free services provided by the
          public hospitals. However, those patients able and willing to pay for
          extra-benefit-package services, are offered the services at a fee.
          (MoH, 2023)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ii. Public-Private Partnerships (PPP):</strong> To augment
          levels of domestic health financing the government put together a
          policy for Public-Private partnerships to encourage the private
          sector’s participation in healthcare financing. The Health Sector
          Strategic Plan recognizes this as an avenue to improve health
          equipment and infrastructure. According to National Health Accounts
          reports, while Total health expenditure has been increasing, capital
          expenditure has been relatively constant as shown in Figure 2 below.
          (MoH, 2020). This low capital investment is one contributor to
          low-quality services in the country. Apart from enhancing the quality
          and efficiency of existing healthcare infrastructures, Public-Private
          Partnerships are key to upgrading the quantity of the infrastructures.
          As of 2020, the Public-Private Partnership between the Christian
          Association of Malawi (CHAM) and the Malawi government is the only PPP
          in force, and it is on services provision. (Tobias, 2020)
        </p>

        <h3>2.4.6 Resource Pooling</h3>
        <p>
          Resource pooling involves grouping collected healthcare resources to
          spread financial risk across the population. It prevents the poor from
          carrying the full burden of paying for healthcare on their own.
          Resource pooling enables cross-subsidization from the rich to the
          poor, from the sick to the healthy, and from the young to the old.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>i. The Health Service Joint Fund (HSJF):</strong> A
          multi-donor pooling arrangement established by the Malawi government
          and its development partners to support the country’s health financing
          system. Set up in 2015, the fund’s objective is to pool, coordinate,
          and channel donor resources to address priority health service
          constraints in Malawi. (MoH, 2017)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>ii. Private health insurance:</strong> Pooling resources via
          private health insurance in Malawi contributes only a small share of
          pooling efforts in the health financing system as the health insurance
          market in Malawi is in its youthful stage comprising only one major
          firm called the Malawi Aid Society of Malawi (MASM) followed by a few
          other medical schemes that are in their infancy. (MASM, 2024; Makoka,
          Kaluwa & Kambewa, 2007)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>iii. Social Health Insurance:</strong> The effective
          implementation of social health insurance in Malawi is a challenge
          mainly because the formal sector from which most of the premiums are
          to be collected is narrow (World Bank Group, 2017). Strategies to
          include the informal sector are outlined in the Health Sector
          Strategic Plan III (MoH, 2023)
        </p>

        <h3>2.4.7 Challenges of the Health Financing System</h3>
        <p>
          Some challenges include inadequate government funding, the lateness of
          government funding, a decline in donor funding, inefficiency and
          inequity in resource pooling, and weakness in the income generation
          capacity of hospitals and councils. (Hanif & Musvoto, 2023)
        </p>

        <h3>2.4.8 Efforts and Policy Reforms: HSSP III, 2023-2030</h3>
        <p>
          The Ministry of Health has outlined strategies to improve resource
          mobilization, pooling, and healthcare purchasing while reshaping the
          system to eliminate inefficiencies. Strategies include increasing
          government budget allocation, implementing paying services at all
          levels, community-based resource mobilization, promotion of private
          health financing, efficiency and equity in pooling, strategic
          purchasing, and rationing health benefits.
