        <h3>5.5 Discussion of Findings</h3>
        <p>
          The analysis shows that wealth, insurance coverage, presence of young
          children and elderly members, certain illnesses, and choice of health
          facility were significant predictors of CHE. Higher wealth quintiles
          and urban residence reduced CHE risk, whereas having insurance,
          chronic illness, young children, elderly members, and using mission or
          private facilities increased CHE likelihood. Education, sex of
          household head, and household size were largely non-significant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Out-of-pocket spending pushed 1.7% of households into financial
          hardship, while 0.7% were newly impoverished and 1.4% of the already
          poor became deeper in poverty. Vulnerable households—those with young
          children, elderly, or chronically ill members—experienced
          disproportionate financial risk. Insured households faced unexpectedly
          higher CHE risk, possibly due to adverse selection or limited
          coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Illness-specific and health-seeking behaviour factors strongly
          influenced CHE. Chronic and recurrent conditions such as hypertension,
          body and joint pains, malaria, sore throat, stomach ache, and wounds
          were major cost drivers. Households using mission/CHAM or private
          facilities incurred higher CHE, reflecting higher user fees and OOP
          costs.
        </p>

        <h3>5.6 Policy Implications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expand prepayment and risk-pooling mechanisms, including
            community-based and national health insurance, with subsidies for
            the poor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strengthen health system responses to communicable and
            non-communicable diseases, focusing on prevention, early detection,
            and primary care management.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce financial burden in mission/CHAM and private facilities via
            better subsidies, service-level agreements, and price regulation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Target vulnerable households (with children under five or elderly
            members) with grants, maternal and child health programs, and social
            protection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review insurance benefit packages and reimbursement systems to
            ensure genuine financial protection.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These policy actions are essential to reduce financial risk from
          health spending and advance Malawi’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC)
          and Sustainable Development Goal 3.8.
