        <h2>Chapter 6 — Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This chapter presents a synthesis of key findings from the study on
          catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment in Malawi. It
          summarizes the main results, draws conclusions, and offers
          recommendations for policy, practice, and future research. The chapter
          also highlights the study’s contributions to knowledge and outlines
          its limitations.
        </p>

        <h3>6.2 Summary of Findings</h3>
        <p>This study found:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Incidence and intensity of CHE:</strong>
            <p>
              Approximately one in four households experienced CHE at the 10%
              threshold of total household expenditure. At the 40% non-food
              expenditure threshold, 1.7% of households incurred CHE, with a
              mean overshoot of 6.33%.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inequalities in CHE distribution:</strong>
            <p>
              Female-headed, rural, and older-headed households experienced
              higher CHE risk. Households with children under five, elderly
              members, or chronic illness were particularly vulnerable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Socioeconomic disparities:</strong>
            <p>
              Poorest households had highest CHE incidence (11.4%) vs. richest
              (3.4%). Low education and larger households were associated with
              higher CHE risk.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unexpected insurance effect:</strong>
            <p>
              Insured households experienced higher CHE than uninsured,
              suggesting coverage limitations or adverse selection.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disease-specific financial risk:</strong>
            <p>
              Households reporting hypertension, joint pain, malaria/fever,
              stomach ache, and other chronic illnesses had higher CHE odds.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Health-seeking behavior and facility choice:</strong>
            <p>
              Use of private and mission/CHAM facilities increased CHE risk,
              while informal sources lowered risk.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Poverty and impoverishment:</strong>
            <p>
              OOP health payments increased poverty headcount by 0.7% and
              deepened the poverty gap by 1.4%, particularly among vulnerable,
              rural, and low-education households.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>6.3 Conclusions</h3>
        <p>
          CHE and impoverishment remain significant challenges in Malawi.
          Vulnerable groups, including female-headed, poor, less educated, large
          households, and those with children under five, elderly, or chronic
          illness, face disproportionate financial risk. Insurance coverage was
          unexpectedly associated with higher CHE, suggesting gaps in benefit
          coverage. Households using private or mission/CHAM facilities face
          higher financial risk. These findings highlight systemic gaps in
          Malawi’s health financing system.
        </p>

        <h3>6.4 Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Policy recommendations include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Strengthen prepayment and risk pooling mechanisms:</strong>
            Expand insurance coverage, benefit packages, and reduce OOP costs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Target vulnerable households:</strong> Subsidies or social
            protection for female-headed, elderly, children under five, chronic
            illness, and poorest quintiles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Address cost disparities:</strong> Regulate or subsidize
            private and mission/CHAM facilities.
          </li>

            infrastructure and workforce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disease-specific protection:</strong> Subsidize medicines
            and management programs for chronic/acute illnesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promote preventive healthcare and literacy:</strong> Expand
            community health education and preventive measures.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Evaluate insurance schemes:</strong> Assess and reform
            coverage gaps and benefits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improve healthcare access and affordability:</strong> Invest
            in public-sector facilities, especially rural areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Enhance preventive care:</strong> Strengthen public health
            campaigns to reduce chronic illness burden.
          </li>
        </ol>
