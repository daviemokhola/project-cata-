        <p>
          <strong>Source:</strong> Author’s compilation based on reviewed
          literature (2025)
        </p>

        <p>
          Table 3.1 above is a Literature Matrix summarizing the reviewed
          literature in this study. The reviewed literature demonstrates that
          catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) are influenced by a wide range
          of socioeconomic, demographic, and health-related factors. Generally,
          studies in Malawi and other low- and middle-income countries
          consistently show that household size, education level, income status,
          geographic location, and type of healthcare facility accessed play
          critical roles in determining financial risk protection outcomes.
          Households with elderly members, individuals living with chronic
          illnesses, or those utilizing mission and private facilities have been
          shown to experience a greater risk of CHE, while households with more
          working adults or access to social safety nets are often protected.
          These findings also extend to the impoverishing effects of
          out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare payments, with studies confirming that
          OOP expenditures often increase both the poverty headcount and the
          poverty gap, pushing vulnerable households deeper into poverty.
        </p>

        <h3>3.6 Gaps in Literature</h3>
        <p>
          Although existing literature has advanced the understanding of the
          determinants and impoverishing effects of catastrophic health
          expenditures (CHE), important gaps remain. First, there is limited
          analysis within Malawi of illness-specific determinants of CHE and how
          health-seeking behaviors, including the use of private, mission/CHAM,
          or informal facilities, as well as the choice to forgo care entirely
          affect household financial risk protection. Most studies have focused
          on broad socioeconomic and demographic variables, leaving illness
          profiles and behavioral aspects largely unexplored despite their
          likely influence on healthcare costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, there is little recent evidence on how out-of-pocket (OOP)
          healthcare spending affects both the incidence and depth of poverty in
          Malawi, particularly within the context of evolving health sector
          reforms. The Malawi Health Financing Strategy (2023–2030) and Health
          Sector Strategic Plan III (HSSP III) emphasise financial risk
          protection and progress toward universal health coverage (UHC).
          However, empirical evidence quantifying the extent of CHE and poverty
          transitions under these new frameworks remains scarce.
        </p>
        <p>
          This study addresses these gaps by integrating illness profiles and
          health-seeking behaviors into the analysis of CHE determinants,
          alongside traditional socioeconomic and demographic factors. It also
          provides updated, nationally representative evidence on the
          impoverishing effects of OOP healthcare spending. The findings are
          expected to inform policy decisions on sustainable health financing
          and improved financial protection, particularly in light of current
          health sector reforms and efforts to reduce donor dependency.
